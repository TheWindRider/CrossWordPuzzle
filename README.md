# CrossWordPuzzle
A canvas for future project

## Key Element
1. Words list
2. Words clue
3. Crossword puzzle layout
4. (more)

What feels interesting to me is these elements can be either input or output depending on the application.
A puzzle layout can be the input to a solver UI, but can also be the output of an automatic generator.
